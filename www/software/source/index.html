<h1>Getting the source</h1>

<p>You can download the source code for the Serval Mesh from <a href=http://github.com/servalproject>http://github.com/servalproject</a>.
<p>Of course, if you are using a mesh extender because there is no internet access, that could be a bit tricky.  In that case, you should take a look in <a href=files>here</a>.  You will need to find your own C compiler.
